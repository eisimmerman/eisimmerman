- 👋 Hi, I’m @eisimmerman
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of AI and technology in recruiting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use QR codes in recruiting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to imbed/encode identifcation info in the QR code.  For example I can use the free online QR code generators to point to a job advertisement on the web but I want the QR code to also identify the source it came from (e.g., email, career site, LinkedIn etc.) and identify me as the recruiter.
- 📫 How to reach me ...simmerman.eric@gmail.com
My non-coding attempt was something like:  Code Details - Destination: https://smrtr.io/6dC96;source=Email;recruiter=Eric and it resolves to the destination of https://smrtr.io/6dC96 but how do I know if the soure and recruiter identification info will be captured by the applicant tracking system?
